                    <p>
                        Transcripts are created from the list of transcripts in
                        your <a href="{{url_for('basic.index')}}">dashboard</a>.
                        Click the <strong>+ Create Transcript</strong> button to add
                        a new transcript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new transcript form will open and you can start filling in
                        your student's information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The transcript form has four pages: <i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Student,
                        <i class="fas fa-school"></i> School, <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Academics, and
                        <i class="fas fa-signature"></i> Signature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Student and <i class="fas fa-school"></i> School
                        pages are where you enter the contact information for your student and your school.
                        To enter your address, first select your country from the dropdown and then click
                        <strong>+ Add Address</strong>. For US addresses, a standard address form will be shown.
                        For addresses outside the US, a textbox will be shown. You should enter your address like
                        it would appear on an envelope.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Academics page is where you enter the courses your
                        student completed during each year of enrollment and the grades and credits that were awarded
                        for each
                        course. This is the most complex step, so we'll explain how it works in more detail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Academics page is broken down into four years.
                        The years are arranged in chronological order from Freshman to Senior. To add a course to a
                        school
                        year, click the <strong>+ Add Another Row</strong> button under the year that course was taken.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each course has a title, category, type, grade, and credits. The title is the name of the
                        course.
                        The category is the category or subject the course falls under, e.g. English or Math.
                        The type of the course marks whether it was an honors or AP course.
                        The grade field holds the letter grade the student received for the course (see below on how
                        letter grades become grade point averages).
                        The credits fields indicates how many highschool credits the course is worth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Most US states and universities have requirements
                            on how many credits a highschool course is worth.
                        </strong><br>
                        With the exception of Indiana, Idaho, New Jersey, and
                        California, a highscool course which lasts one year or
                        120 hours of instruction is generally worth one credit.

                    <p>
                        The <i class="fas fa-signature"></i> Signature page allows you to enter information about who
                        certifies that the information in the transcript is accurate. You may enter their title, the
                        date the transcript was signed and optionally upload an image of their signature. There is also
                        a notes field for any information that doesn't fit into the rest of the transcript.

                        to the left of the transcript you would like to delete. <br>

                        Because deleting a transcript could cause you to lose a lot of work, you will need to
                        confirm that you want to delete the transcript.<br>

                    <p>
                        The default grading scale uses a four point system with letter grades from A+ to F.
                        Honors and AP courses have their grades weighted. Honors courses can receive a maximum
                        of 4.5 points and AP courses can receive a maximum of 5 points. Half credit courses can
                        receive a maximum of 2 points.

                    <p>
                        If you use a grading system that is not based on a 4 point system or
                        A through F letter grades, you can use a custom grading scale. Grading scales
                        can be created from the <a href="{{url_for('basic.grading_scales')}}">Grading Scales</a>
                        tab in your <a href="{{url_for('basic.index')}}">dashboard</a>. Simply click the <strong>+ New
                            Grading Scale</strong> button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each grading scale has a name, and a set of grade increments.
                        Grade increments are added by clicking the <strong>+ Add Grade Increment</strong> button
                        when editing the grading scale. <br>
                        <strong>You must name and save your grading scale before you can add an increment</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each grade increment has a letter grade and a GPA value. The letter grade is what you will put
                        for the grade when
                        entering courses on the transcript, and the GPA value is what will be used to calculate your
                        student's GPA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you need to include honors or AP courses and wish to use a weighted version of your custom
                        grading
                        scale, you will need to add a separate, weighted version of your scale for each.

                    <p>
                        You may set the grading scale each transcript uses at the top of the <i
